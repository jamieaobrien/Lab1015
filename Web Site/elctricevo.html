											<h2>Electrical Evolution</h2> </header>
										<p>
											Over the course of our project, we created and iterated through a lot of circuit designs as our robots gained more functions and
											required more complicated parts. The electrical component of our robot increased greatly during the second sprint as we decided
											to make the main focus of the game our robots play from sumo wrestling to laser tag. Although the electrical component is not as
											heavy as the software component, it provided its own challenges and problems through our process.

												<h3>Sprint 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In the first sprint our robots circuit only consisted of the arduino, the bluetooth module and the two motors. We also used 8
												AA alkaline batteries to power our robot. These components were the basic things our robot needed to be made up of. There was not
												many issues with the electrical components at this point in the project because the circuit was very basic and we did not have very
												many of them. A circuit diagram can be seen to the right for sprint 1.

												<h3>Sprint 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												During the second sprint, we decided to make the focus of our game laser tag, in order to add a greater electrical challenge and to
												make the game our robots were used to play more fun. We somewhat underestimated the challenge of including IR sensors and LEDs into
												our project because the IR LEds would need to pulse at a certain rate for the sensors to know that they had been hit. We had a lot
												of trouble using the arduino software to get the LEDs to pulse at the correct frequency. Eventually, we found tutorials online, and
												we were able to make code based off of that to create the lasers for our robot. We were unable to find the time to actually put the entire
												robot together, but the planned circuit diagram can be seen to the right.

												<h3>Sprint 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												For the third sprint we changed a lot of the pinouts for our components for the sake of clarity and to match our code. The major addition
												was the visible laser that we decided to include to help the user aim since they were unable to see the light coming from the IR LED. We
												discovered that the IR LED created a problem for us because it drained a large amount of current from the circuit, which left all of the
												components without power. We decided to switch to nickel metal hydride, which produce more current than alkaline batteries, to a compensate
												for the huge drain caused by the visible laser. We were able to fully get IR LEDs fully functional and tested them to see that the robot responded
												to being hit as we expected it to.

												<h3>Final Sprint</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In the final sprint we were having issues with the arduino not listening to commands that came through the bluetooth module.We decided to add
												two LEDs to the circuit to help test that the robot was responding to commands and could execute them as well.
