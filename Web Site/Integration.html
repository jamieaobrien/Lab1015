											<h2>Integration Evolution</h2> </header>
										<p>
											Integration of our robot was always designed to be relatively simple. There were never a great deal of physical pieces that needed to be
											connected to one anotheer. The arduino was always placed within its respective slot on the base, and the circuit board with the neccessary electrical
											components were placed on top of it. The batter pack was also placed within its slot on the base. The integration of software was simple because there was relatively
											few sensors to interact with and the data from the bluetooth module was only being sent one way. However, as more components were added to our robots, there were more
											and more complications
										</p>

												<h3>Sprint 1</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In the first sprint integration was very efficient. The were very few electrical and mechanical components and most of the software that we required for
												interacting with the robot was provided from outside sources, which meant we had fewer issues about debugging our code and spent less time fixing mechanical or
												electrical mistakes. A smaller integration that held a lot of the basic qualities of our robot helped us obtain a better understanding of the processs of integration
												and some of the challenges that it may bring in the future.
											</p>
											<p>
												For the prototype, the mechanical and electrical components worked well together. We only had the bluetooth module and the motors as electrical components, and at
												the beginning of the integration processs, we had assumed that four AA batteries would provide enough power for our robots. However, we underestimated the voltage that the
												bluetooth module and motors would require to function appropriately. The bluetooth module would often turn off while we were testing the robot, which led is to increasing the number of
												batteries we used to eight.
											</p>
											<p>
												The software components acted well within our goals, but we noticed that the software we were using to communicate with the bluetooth board had a very long delay
												between listening for the voice command and sending the data to the arduino. The app had a specific wait time for the voice command, which caused a very long wait time before
												the app would actually send the data. This plus the time it took for the bluetooth board to recieve the data created a gap that would have made gameplay less enjoyable. We decided <thead>
												best way to get rid of the delay was to create our own app that actively listened for  commands and sent them as it recieved them.

												<h3>Sprint 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												During the second sprint, we wer unable to accomplish a full integration of our robot. We did not expect the app to consume the majority of our work time for
												the sprint. We had planned to create two fully functioning robots, and to implement the laser tag aspect of our game into both of them in order to test the viability of
												our gameplay. However, the results of this sprint were seperate pieces of the robot at vary levels of functionality.
											</p>
											<p>
												We had many issues creating the mechanical components because we chose to 3-D print them instead of laser cutting wood, which is a time consuming
												process and is far more prone to error. We had put off 3-D modeling a lot of the mechanocal components of the robot because we believed that the process would be simple. The new
												designs we had created for the robots to make them look more aesthetically pleasing took more time to model than we had intially expected, and we did not have the time to fully print them before
												the sprint had ended.
