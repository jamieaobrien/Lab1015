							<h2>Software</h2>
							<h3>The App User Experience</h3>

							<p> The phone app as it is now is an Android app that has a button to connect to each robot through Bluetooth, and a “warn” button to make Bluetooth disconnect. The UI was built on <a href=“https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/android-docs-samples/tree/master/speech/Speech”>
								  Google Cloud Speech API’s Android demo</a>, and was designed, like our robots, to be playful, aesthetic, and easy to use. When someone speaks to the phone, the app runs speech recognition while listening, and displays the results on
									the screen in cards, so that the user can see what their previous commands are. If the text recognized contains a command, the app will send that command to the Bluetooth board that it’s connected to, and display a pop-up message that says
									“Sent to BT!” to inform the user that it worked.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p> In our UI, there are three buttons at the top for bluetooth configuration. The bee icon will connect you to the bee robot BT board, the dragon connects to the dragon robot BT board, and the caution icon will disconnect the phone from all
								Bluetooth boards. If you are already connected, trying to connect again will result in a pop-up saying “Already Connected”. If you are newly connecting to a robot, the app will display “Connected to [bee or dragon]!”. The disconnection
								button is handy for when you are switching robots, or lose connection. </p>
							<br>
							<p>A big barrier to ease of gameplay for us was the delay between someone speaking a command and the robot actuating it. In our first sprint, someone would say “left”, pray that the app didn’t think “lef” or “let”, and then wait over 6
								seconds for the robot to start turning left. This was not a super exciting game experience. In order to address this problem, we took many steps to optimize the run time of Speech recognition in the app, and to speed up the Bluetooth
								sending/receiving from the app to the arduino. In the end, our delay was shaved down to 1-2 seconds, and the app sent the right commands more consistently. Read about how we minimized delay and improved accuracy with Streaming Speech
								Recognition, Async Tasks (threading), word-filtering, and AT Commands <a href=””>here</a>! </p>
