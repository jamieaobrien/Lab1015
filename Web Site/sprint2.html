								      </ul>
								      <h3>More In-depth Description of Our Product So Far</h3>
								      <p>
								        During the previous sprint, we noticed that our game was very vaguely defined. So, we used the feedback from our Sprint Review to create a game that we think others would enjoy.
								        Our idea for the game consists of an unconstrained laser tag competition for voice-controlled robots. The users continuously give the robots commands, which can direct the robots to hide, chase each other, and shoot lasers (IR LED signals) at each other to defeat your opponent before you lose all your lives. The "lasers" will be IR sensors (TSOP3840) and IR LEDs which emit waves at distinct frequencies.
								      </p>
								      <p>
								        Concerning the other parts of what we accomplished, we made the most progress on creating the phone app. We utilized Android Studio, Android Speech API and a bluetooth module connected to an Arduino to create the app.
								        In terms of the mechanical side, we created bases and shells for dragon-based and bee-based robots. We attempted to 3D-print the components for the dragon-based robot. Unfortunately, we ran into problems.
								        Lastly, we had started to learn about IR LEDs and successfully were able to create an Arduino script that graphs the output of an IR sensor. Using a TV remote, we showed that the IR sensors respond to IR signal input.
								      </p>
								      <h3> The Process</h3>
								      <p>
								        After the fact, we realized that we overscoped our project, primarily the app. We all had no experience in Android Studio, and varied experience in Java, so the learning curve was very high. Nonetheless, we tried long hours to understand and debug code that was a lot higher than our level. This app consumed all of us and we neglected the rest of our subsections.
								      </p>
								      <p>
								        Another problem which we encountered was that we vaguely assigned tasks. Furthermore, due to other commitments, which we forgot we had when creating our goal for this sprint, we missed the deadlines we set for tasks.
								        This problem we contribute to overscoping.
								      </p>
								      <h3> What We Learned From this Sprint</h3>
								      <p>
								        By the Sprint Review, we had talked about our problems from this sprint. We decided that for the next sprint (Sprint 3), we won't give vague tasks. For example, we won't give tasks like "research implementing lasers" but "send and recieve IR LED signals".
								        We will also be more reasonable about what we want to accomplish and in what time frame. </p>
