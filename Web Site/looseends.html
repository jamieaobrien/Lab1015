								<h2>Final Sprint & Demo Day</h2>
							</header>
							</header>
							<a href="team.html" class="image featured"><img src="images/groupphotos/groupPic.jpeg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>After Sprint 3, all we needed to complete was the final sprint- actual sprint, not Sprint Review. By this we mean that we had one week to finish our final product before demo day. </p>

							<h3>"Sprint 4"</h3>
						        <p>
                      We didn't technically have a Sprint 4, but the week leading up to Demo Day we put in a lot of hours.. mostly debugging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Our robots were finicky, and it was caused by many different things. Our batteries were connected in series, and not in parallel, our IR LEDs were frying because of short-circuiting and our Bluetooth was just not responsive. We managed to solve the first two problems before demo day, but not the last.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We also implemented singing into our robot, which was cute !
                    </p>
							<h3>Demo Day</h3>
							<p>The day before demo day, our robots were still finicky, but we decided that we would not do any good after 2am, and that's when we called it quits. </p>
              <p>
                On Demo Day, everyone was very supportive and halfway through our robots became less finicky and playable! We have a compilation of videos from Demo Day on <a href="">our Youtube channel</a> to prove it.
              </p>
