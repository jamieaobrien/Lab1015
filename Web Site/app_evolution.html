                  <h2>Sprint 1</h2>
                </header>
                <br>
                <p>
                  We started by learning about Android Studio and Java, and researched different ways of doing speech recognition. We recorded some voices, and implemented a very rudimentary speech recognition program in Matlab, to see whether it would be feasible to create our own. When we realized how complicated it is to differentiate words, and do so quickly, we decided that a better use of our time would be to use a pre-existing API, with neural networks and huge training data sets already existing.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  At this point in time, none of us had any idea how to make a phone app, and none of us knew Java, the programming language that Android Studio uses. Thus, we decided to start with the Android Speech API in our first app, since it was built for Android Studio, and would likely be the easiest to implement. If we had time later in the project, we would want to switch to one of the harder to implement, higher-functioning APIs. While this research was going on, we downloaded the <a href=”https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iotboys.com”>IOT Boys</a> voice recognition app, so that we could test integration with voice commands and our firmware, mechanical, and electrical components.

                  <h2>Sprint 2</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                  The IOT Boys app was not open source, so we spent most of this sprint familiarizing ourselves with Android Studio, and producing our own version of the IOT Boys app, using the Android Speech API for speech recognition, and adding the functionality of Bluetooth connecting and data-sending.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  This app would record your voice after you clicked the “speak” button, and then use the Android Speech API to run voice recognition and return a string for what you said. When the “Connect to Bluetooth” button is clicked, the app searches for  our HC-05 bluetooth board address, and establishes a connection to it. After processing speech, it sends the full string to the Bluetooth board in bytes, and the BT board sends that data to the Arduino through the Serial monitor. The Arduino then converts the bytes back into a String, and checks if that matches any of the string commands we’ve programmed. In our first iteration, we had the following commands:
                  <ul>
                    <li>“Forward”</li>
                    <li>“Back”</li>
                    <li>“Left”</li>
                    <li>“Right”</li>
                    <li>“Stop”</li>
                    <li>“Ram” (speed boost forward for a second)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                  By this point, our software had reached MVP- we made an app ourselves, and it was able to process and send commands to the Bluetooth module! Our next goal was to shorten the atrocious delay between commands and actuation, and to make the app more reliable/robust.

                <h2>Sprint 3</h2>
              </header>
              <p>
                In this sprint, we tried (and failed) to implement the PocketSphinx speech recognition software in our app. Our downfall was that no one really knew Java, and so we weren’t able to debug the more complicated data structures that this library required. We pivoted to trying the Google Cloud Speech API, which had more resources available, so we were luckily able to download a demo version, and customize it to our needs. This made integration possible with a faster speech recognition service (streaming recognition).
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                However, at this point in time the app was not very robust. There were times when the app would pause and simply stop listening- there is no on or off button in the streaming recognition service, so the only way to debug this was to close the app and open it up again. The Bluetooth connection process also took a significant amount of computing power, so it would occasionally cause the app to crash. We addressed these problems in the next sprint.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p> The commands in this sprint remained about the same from the last, with the exception of “shoot”, for shooting lasers. We also added synonyms for words, like “fire”, “pew pew”, “write”, “go”, and “halt”.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p> The app UI also changed, because we added buttons to connect the user to different robots. Each robot has a different Bluetooth board, with a unique code. Clicking on a robot’s button would connect the phone with its BT board, enabling the app to send data to the robot’s Arduino.

                  <h2>Final Sprint<h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                  We started sprint 4 by fixing the missing pieces of the dragon CAD and reprinting the base for the bee. We also needed to pick the motors we wanted to use. Our robots were heavier than we had initially planned, so we needed a fair
                  amount of
                  torque to get them moving. We scavenged through the PoE supplies and found some motor systems with built-in gearboxes we decided to use. We also thought using different motors for the bee and dragon could be really fun, so we
                  decided to
                  give the bee a less geared-down drive train than the dragon.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Because we were using new motors, we needed to design new motor mounts. These were CADed late at night, and ended up having more than a few dimensioning errors once they were printed. We learned a valuable lesson that CAD should be
                  done by
                  someone in a clear state of mind, and not at 2 AM on three hours of sleep. We decided we should use the motor mounts anyway, so we broke off pieces we didn't want with flush cutters and made what we had work.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Once everything was done we decided to make our robots more aesthetically pleasing by spray painting them. We began with a white base coat since both were printed in black filament, then planned on going over everything with colors
                  we
                  thought would look good. Unfortunately, we ran into problems while spray painting the color on the dragon, and the base coat began peeling up. We decided that since there were a few other issue such as the size of the sensor holes
                  in the
                  shell being too small and the original spikes not being super family-friendly, so we decided to make a few modifications and reprint it (in white so we wouldn’t need a base coat).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  Once everything was printed, we carefully re-spray painted it and put it all together. We had almost all mechanical work done around a week before the final, so we had time to debug and test other systems.
                </p>
